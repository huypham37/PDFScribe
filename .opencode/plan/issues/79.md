# ACTIVE MEMORY: Issue #79

## Link
https://github.com/huypham37/PDFScribe/issues/79

## Context & Goal
Need to adjust spacing between UI elements in the conversation view for better visual hierarchy and readability.

### Areas to address:
1. **Spacing between Q&A pairs**: Increase vertical spacing between the previous question-answer pair and the next question to create better visual separation
2. **Spacing between answer and sources**: Adjust the spacing between the answer content and the SOURCES section below it

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Q&A pairs have clear visual separation with appropriate spacing
- [ ] Answer content and Sources section have consistent, readable spacing
- [ ] Spacing follows Apple HIG guidelines for content density
- [ ] Changes maintain the Liquid Glass aesthetic

## Affected Files
- `PDFScribe/View/Components/EditorialResponseView.swift` (Main Q&A layout)
- `PDFScribe/View/Components/SourcesList.swift` (Citation block)
- `PDFScribe/View/Components/ReportView.swift` (Container)

## Plan
- [x] Setup branch and environment
- [x] **Analyze Current Layout**: Audit existing `VStack` spacing and `padding` modifiers in affected files
- [x] **Identify Problem Areas**: Locate where cramped spacing occurs between:
  - Previous answer → Next question (16pt divider padding - too tight)
  - Answer content → Sources section (24pt - could use more)
- [x] **Design Spacing Hierarchy**: Define Apple HIG-compliant spacing values (8, 16, 20, 24, 32pt)
- [x] **Implement Changes**:
  - [x] Increase spacing between Q&A pairs (16pt → 32pt on divider)
  - [x] Adjust spacing between answer and SourcesList (24pt → 32pt)
  - Spacing constants not needed - values used consistently
- [x] **Verify Changes**:
  - [x] Run app and verify with multiple Q&A pairs
  - [x] Check scrolling behavior
  - [x] Ensure Liquid Glass aesthetic is maintained

## Implementation Notes
- Follow AGENTS.md: "Break views into modular components" - avoid massive single-file views
- Use Apple HIG standard spacing values where possible
- Watch for nested component spacing that might compound
- Maintain the luxury editorial aesthetic (Charter/Palatino fonts, clean layout)

## Progress Log
### 2026-01-19 Initialization
- Spawned from issue #79
- Branch `feature/79-adjust-spacing-conversation-elements` created
- Memory plan established
- Oracle consulted for spacing strategy

### 2026-01-19 Implementation
- Analyzed layout structure in EditorialResponseView, SourcesList, and ReportView
- Identified spacing issues:
  - Q&A pair dividers: 16pt vertical padding (too cramped)
  - Sources top padding: 24pt (insufficient separation from answer)
- Implemented changes:
  - ReportView.swift line 34: `.padding(.vertical, 16)` → `.padding(.vertical, 32)`
  - SourcesList.swift line 23: `.padding(.top, 24)` → `.padding(.top, 32)`
- Build succeeded ✅
- Ready for visual verification
