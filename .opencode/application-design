# PDFScribe Design System: "The Living Archive"

## Brand Character
**The Library, The Partner, Tactile Paper, Fluid Canvas, and Discovery.**

PDFScribe is not a software tool—it's a high-end oak desk where the "ink" (the AI) helps you think. The brand character is "The Living Archive": a physical, warm, intellectual space that feels like a well-worn study with quality paper, leather accents, and the subtle presence of a thoughtful research partner.

## Core Philosophy
- **Vibe:** Library warmth, Tactile scholarship, "The Partner" presence, Fluid thinking.
- **Goal:** Less software, more sanctuary. A desk where ideas live and breathe.
- **Interaction:** Drag-and-drop fluidity, margin notes, ghost text suggestions.

## Visual Language

### 1. The "Paper & Ink" Color Palette
Avoid pure blacks and whites. Channel the warmth of a physical library.

*   **Paper (Background):** `#FDFCF8` (Antique white, warm paper tone)
*   **Primary Ink:** `#2D3436` (Deep charcoal grey, softer than black)
*   **Partner Accent (Leather/Gold Leaf):** `#8E735B` (Muted brown, represents the AI presence)
*   **Highlight (Vintage Yellow):** `#F1E4C3` (Soft highlighter tone for selections)
*   **Subtle Divider:** `#E8E4DF` (Light warm grey for soft separators)

### 2. Typography Strategy ("The Desk, The Margin, The Archive")
*   **The Editor (Serious Writing):** Iowan Old Style or New York (Serif).
    *   Used for: User notes, primary content.
    *   Why: High-quality, editorial, timeless.
*   **The Margin (Typewriter Notes):** SF Mono (Monospace, small sizes).
    *   Used for: Citations, metadata, AI margin notes.
    *   Why: Feels like marginalia, archival annotations.
*   **The Navigation:** San Francisco (Clean Sans).
    *   Used for: File browser, toolbar, settings.
    *   Why: Invisible, functional, unobtrusive.

### 3. The "Fluid Canvas" Interaction
*   **No Hard Borders:** The three columns shouldn't feel rigid. Use very thin, light-grey separators (`#E8E4DF`) or just whitespace.
*   **Partner Glow:** When dragging a PDF highlight, the AI panel should glow subtly in the Partner Accent (`#8E735B`) to show it's ready to receive.
*   **Translucency:** Use `UltraThinMaterial` for sidebars to blend with the desktop environment.
*   **Spacing:** Generous padding. The desk should breathe.

### 4. The "Partner" Presence
The AI should feel like a research assistant working in the margins, not a chat window.

*   **Margin Notes Mode:** AI suggestions appear as "ghost text" or small "ink blots" in the editor margin.
*   **Click to Expand:** Subtle suggestions that expand into full responses when engaged.
*   **Quiet Assistance:** The AI panel should feel like a notebook on the side of your desk, not a primary focus.

## Design Principles
1. **The Desk, Not The Tool:** The interface should disappear. You're sitting at an oak desk, not using software.
2. **Tactile Paper:** Colors and materials should evoke physical quality—warm paper, ink, leather accents.
3. **The Partner, Not The Assistant:** The AI feels like a colleague working beside you, not a service you invoke.
4. **Fluid Canvas:** Drag-and-drop should feel natural. The three panels are zones on a desk, not rigid containers.
5. **Discovery Over Commands:** Ghost text, margin notes, subtle glows—guide the user through atmosphere, not instructions.
6. **Timeless Warmth:** This should feel as inviting in 5 years as it does today. Library-quality, not trend-chasing.
