## Movement Effects
- **Slide**: Element moves in from a direction (left, right, up, down)
- **Bounce**: Element bounces like a ball when appearing or moving
- **Swing**: Element swings back and forth like a pendulum
- **Shake/Wobble**: Element vibrates or shakes horizontally or vertically
- **Float**: Element gently moves up and down continuously
- **Drift**: Slow, gentle sideways or diagonal movement

## Appearance/Disappearance Effects
- **Fade**: Gradually appears or disappears (opacity change)
- **Pop**: Suddenly appears with a quick scale-up
- **Zoom**: Grows or shrinks from center
- **Glow/Pulse**: Brightens or scales slightly in and out repeatedly
- **Blink/Flash**: Quick on-off visibility
- **Dissolve**: Breaks apart or fades away in pieces

## Attention-Drawing Effects
- **Heartbeat**: Quick double-pulse like a heartbeat
- **Jello/Jiggle**: Wiggly, elastic movement
- **Rubber band**: Stretches then snaps back
- **Ripple**: Waves emanate outward from center
- **Shimmer/Shine**: Light sweeps across the surface
- **Flicker**: Irregular blinking or brightness changes

## Rotation Effects
- **Spin**: Rotates 360 degrees
- **Flip**: Rotates 180 degrees (like flipping a card)
- **Roll**: Rotates while moving horizontally

These are the descriptive terms that communicate the visual experience without needing technical knowledge. Just say "I want a bounce effect" or "make it pulse" and an LLM should understand the general animation you're looking for.
